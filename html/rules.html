                can below a minute with little time to read the questions. Here not only the general knowledge is asked, but also the intuitive decision making
                under stressing conditions. So far no one has managed to hit the golden 100% score. Why don't you try to be first person to achieve this feat? And no 
                cheating, ain't nobody got time for that.
